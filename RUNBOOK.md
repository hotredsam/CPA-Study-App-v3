# RUNBOOK — CPA Study App

Operational reference. Fast answers first, detail below.

## Quickstart (fresh machine)

```bash
pnpm install
docker compose up -d          # postgres
pnpm prisma migrate deploy
pnpm dev                      # http://localhost:3000
pnpm trigger:dev              # Trigger.dev dev runner (separate terminal)
```

Required env vars (see `.env.example`):

- `DATABASE_URL` — local: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/cpa`
- `R2_*` — Cloudflare R2 credentials (endpoint, access key, secret, bucket)
- `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` — Trigger.dev secret (dev scope)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — for Tasks 5 + 7 once wired

## Record a session

1. Go to `/record`.
2. Pick a mic (Default is fine) and click **Start recording**.
3. Browser asks for a screen/window/tab — pick the Becker tab.
4. Work through questions normally; narrate your reasoning.
5. Click **Stop** or close the shared tab.
6. Watch the upload progress bar fill; on completion you're routed to `/recordings/<id>/status`.

## Watch the pipeline

- **Live**: `/recordings/<id>/status` — every stage, every pct, every sub-row.
- **Trigger.dev dashboard**: run logs, retries, errors with stack traces.
- **Prisma Studio**: `pnpm prisma studio` → `Recording`, `Question`, `Feedback`, `StageProgress`.

## Review graded questions

- `/review/<questionId>` — question, choices, user vs correct answer, Becker
  explanation, transcript with clickable word timestamps, 10 feedback items.
- Prev/next: on-screen buttons OR `←` / `→` keys.

## Reprocess a failed recording

The pipeline is idempotent per stage. Two ways to retry:

1. **From the Trigger.dev dashboard**: open the failed run, click **Replay**.
2. **From a DB record**: POST again to `/api/recordings/<id>/complete`. The
   route triggers `processRecording`, which upserts `Question`/`Feedback`.

## Re-trigger a single stage

`processRecording` is the orchestrator. To re-run a single child task:

- Open the Trigger.dev run in the dashboard, pick the child run you want
  (e.g. the `transcribeQuestion` run for `questionId=X`), and Replay it.
- The metadata pipes back into `/recordings/<id>/status` automatically.

## Swap the Whisper model

Default: `ggml-small.en.bin`. If accuracy lags:

- Edit the Trigger.dev build extension to download `ggml-medium.en.bin` instead.
- Redeploy the Trigger.dev tasks (`pnpm trigger deploy`).
- Monitor Task 6 runtime on a known fixture; if >15× realtime, bump the
  machine size (`large-2x` → `large-4x`) before going back to `small.en`.

## Common failures

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/record` shows "permission denied" | OS denied screen-capture | Grant Chrome permission in OS settings |
| Upload stalls at 0% | R2 presigned URL expired (15 min) | Re-click Start — a fresh URL is minted |
| Status page shows amber "no runId" | Trigger.dev secret missing | Set `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY`, restart `pnpm dev` |
| `segmentRecording` emits the stub marker | Task 4 not yet live | Expected until fixture boundaries are locked — see `sam-input/TODO.xml` |
| `gradeQuestion` writes empty items | Task 7 not yet live | Same — blocked on 10-item key lock |
| Word-timestamps missing | `ggml-small.en` w/o `token_timestamps` | Enabled by default in `src/lib/whisper.ts`; verify `smart-whisper` version |

## Tests

- `pnpm test` — vitest (unit + integration)
- `pnpm e2e` — playwright (boots `pnpm dev`, runs chromium)
- `pnpm typecheck` — tsc --noEmit
- `pnpm lint` — next lint

## Where to look when something is weird

- **Pipeline state in the DB**: `StageProgress` rows track the last snapshot
  per recording/stage — useful for post-hoc debugging when a run is gone.
- **Realtime public token**: minted server-side in
  `src/app/recordings/[id]/status/page.tsx`, read-only scope for the run.
- **Progress plumbing**: `src/trigger/progress.ts` throttles writes to 1Hz.
- **Schemas**: `src/lib/schemas/*` are authoritative. The UI tolerates stub
  shapes today; once a schema's `.parse()` replaces `.safeParse()` in the
  renderer, remove the tolerances.

## Open blockers (see `sam-input/TODO.xml`)

- `2026-04-17-fixture-boundaries` — need human-validated question boundaries on
  the four sample recordings so Tasks 4 + 5 can be verified end-to-end.
- 10-item feedback keys — must be locked before Task 7 grading goes live.
